# 3D Object Transformation

## Overview

The 3D Object Transformation project is a tool designed to manipulate and transform 3D objects in various ways. This project showcases advanced techniques in 3D graphics and transformation algorithms, allowing users to perform operations such as translation, rotation, scaling, and more on 3D models.

## Features

- **Translation**: Move 3D objects along the X, Y, and Z axes.
- **Rotation**: Rotate objects around different axes with adjustable angles.
- **Scaling**: Resize objects uniformly or non-uniformly.
- **Multiple Transformations**: Apply multiple transformations in sequence.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive interface for easy manipulation of 3D objects.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Libraries**: vtk, tkinter
